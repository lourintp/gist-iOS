# gist-iOS
App that allows users to comment on a Github Gist.

Run pod install before running the project.

The project needs to have a private token from github (Gist). After creating this token, insert it on Info.plist file in the apiKey attribute.

If you're running the app in a simulator, the camera won't work, so you can type de Gist ID in the prompt that will pop in the first screen.
